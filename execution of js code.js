// how js is executed in compiler


// 1) Memory creation
// we are allocating memory to all the variables and functions inside the global space
// we are allocating undefined to these variables
// for function we are just storing whole blocks of function


//  2) code execution phase
// program is execution goes line by line
// replace undefined with value

//   it becomes too complex 
// so stack came i.e.call stack
// --> call stack maintains the order of execution of execution contexts


// call stack is known by 
// 1) execution contexts stack
// 2) program stack
// 3) control stack
// 4) runtime stack
// 5) machine stack
